  You can put example (both good and bad) solutions in the task folder. They
  can be then used to test the task, to check that they get the expected scores
  on each test case.

  To add a test solution, execute
    taskstarter.py addsol -g [GRADE] -l [LANG] [path_to_solution]
  to add the solution to the list of solutions to test against the task,
  for instance
    taskstarter.py addsol -g 100 -l c tests/gen/solution.c
