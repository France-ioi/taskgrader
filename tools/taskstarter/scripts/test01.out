Output expected from the test #1
This file is a hardcoded test for the solution, and corresponds to the expected
output from the solution; the checker might or might not use this file to
compare the output from the solution to this reference.
(The default checker needs this file.)

Each X.out file will be given to the checker when X.in is used as a test file.

Put other .out files in this folder to get them automatically added.

EDIT ME (remove this line and all lines above when writing your test case)
