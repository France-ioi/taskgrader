    <h1>Gomoku testing</h1>

    <div id="task">

      <h3 id="statement">Statement</h3>
      <p>For this task, a few "solution" programs are given to find the winning player in a game of Gomoku. However, these "solutions" all have mistakes in them. Your task is to write <b>valid</b> test cases, on which these bad "solution programs" output the wrong result.</p>
      <p>There are 4 wrong solutions, your submission must be a set of tests where for each wrong solution, at least one test case highlight their mistake (by making them output a wrong result). All test cases written will be submitted for evaluation at the same time.</p>

      <h3>Gomoku</h3>
      <p>Gomoku is a board game with two players, where in order to win, a player must manage to align 5 pawns on consecutive spots of the board, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The board is a square of any dimension.</p>
      <p>Solutions are given on input: <i>N</i> the size of the square, and then the contents of the board as <i>N x N</i> integers representing either a pawn from player 1 or 2 (values 1 or 2), either an empty spot (value 0).</p>

      <h3>Example test case</h3>
      <p>Here is an example test case; you must submit test cases in the same format.</p>
      <pre>6
0 0 2 0 1 0
0 1 2 2 2 1
0 0 2 0 1 0
0 0 2 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0</pre>
      <p>In this example test case, the grid is of size 6 (first line), and we then have the grid (row 1 has two empty spots, then a player 2 pawn, then an empty spot, then a player 1 pawn, then a last empty spot). Here, player 1 wins; a correct solution will simply output "1".</p>
    </div>

   <div class="hint">
     Try various sizes of grids, various winning players and various alignment directions.
   </div>

    <div id="solution">
